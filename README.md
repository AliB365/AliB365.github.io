## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Add Your Images

Save your mascot and favicon images to the `assets/images/` folder:
- `mascot.png` - The full robot mascot image
- `favicon.png` - The robot head for the favicon

### 2. Run the Blog Locally

**Option A: Using Node.js (Recommended)**
```powershell
npm start
```
This will start a local server at http://localhost:3000

**Option B: Using Python**
```powershell
python -m http.server 3000
```

**Option C: Using VS Code Live Server Extension**
- Install the "Live Server" extension
- Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

### 3. View Your Blog

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## ✍️ Adding New Blog Posts

Blog posts are now individual HTML files for better SEO and performance! Each post has its own dedicated page that search engines can index.

### Quick Start - Using the Generator Script (Recommended)

The easiest way to create a new post is with the automated script:

```powershell
.\new-post.ps1
```

The script will:
- ✅ Ask for post details (title, excerpt, author, tags, etc.)
- ✅ Generate a URL-friendly slug automatically
- ✅ Create the HTML file with proper structure
- ✅ Add the post to `data/posts-index.json`
- ✅ Set up all metadata and formatting
- ✅ Create starter content you can customize

**Example:**
```powershell
PS> .\new-post.ps1

Enter post title: My Awesome AI Article
Enter post excerpt: Learn about the latest AI trends
Enter author name: John Doe
Enter estimated read time: 7
Enter tags: ai,agents
Make this featured? (y/n): n

✓ Created: posts/my-awesome-ai-article.html
✓ Added to blog index
```

### Manual Method

If you prefer to create posts manually:

1. **Copy the template** from `posts/README.md`
2. **Create your HTML file** in the `posts/` directory (e.g., `posts/my-new-post.html`)
3. **Add entry to index** in `data/posts-index.json`
4. **Done!** Your post appears on the blog automatically

### Adding a Post to the Index

Edit `data/posts-index.json` and add a new entry:

```json
{
  "id": "my-new-post",
  "title": "My Awesome Blog Post",
  "excerpt": "A brief description that appears on the blog grid",
  "url": "posts/my-new-post.html",
  "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "date": "2025-11-15",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "readTime": 5,
  "tags": ["ai", "automation"],
  "featured": false
}
```

### Why Individual HTML Files?

- **SEO Optimized**: Each post has unique title, meta description, and URL
- **Fast Loading**: No JSON parsing or client-side rendering
- **Search Engine Friendly**: Pages are fully indexable
- **Scalable**: Performance stays consistent as blog grows
- **Simple**: Easy to edit, backup, and version control

See `posts/README.md` for the complete HTML template and detailed instructions.

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit `assets/css/style.css` and modify the CSS variables at the top:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #2DD4BF;     /* Teal from mascot */
    --secondary-color: #FBB040;   /* Orange from mascot */
    --dark-bg: #1A1A1A;           /* Main background */
    /* ... more colors ... */
}
```

### Modifying Layout

- **Posts per page**: Edit `POSTS_PER_PAGE` in `assets/js/blog.js`
- **Available tags**: Add new tags to the filter buttons in `index.html` and use them in your posts

### Adding Custom Sections

The HTML structure is modular. You can add new sections by following the existing pattern in `index.html`.
